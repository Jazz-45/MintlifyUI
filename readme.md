# Mintlify Landing Page Clone

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **desktop-first recreation** of the Mintlify developer documentation landing page, built using only HTML and CSS.

The goal was to replicate the original website’s layout structure, typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy as closely as possible while adhering strictly to static frontend constraints (no JavaScript, no frameworks, no animations).
